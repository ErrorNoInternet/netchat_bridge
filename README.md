# netchat_bridge
A NetChat <-> Matrix bridge.

NetChat was this very horrible chat app I made back in 2021, to be used on Kindles. At first, it was just a backend. But then later I slowly added more and more features to it (and a full frontend) without doing any major re-designs, so now it's just a giant pile of spaghetti code. But hey, it still works, and there's still people using it.

This is a Matrix bot that bridges messages between your supplied NetChat room and Matrix room.
